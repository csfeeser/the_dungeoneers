|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Emergency Broadcast**   | - **Steampunk Automatons:** Gears clicking and steam hissing as they patrol, attacking anything not “authorized” to be in the newsroom. <br> - Clockwork hounds sniffing for intruders. <br> - A larger automaton, resembling a Victorian strongman, smashing through walls. <br> - Floating, drone-like automatons projecting blinding light beams. <br> - Mechanical spiders crawling through vents, sabotaging equipment. |
| **Subway Horror**          | - **Eyeless Slick-Skinned Humanoids:** Hairless, pallid creatures clinging to walls and ceilings. <br> - Skittering on all fours with elongated limbs, using echolocation to hunt. <br> - Ambushing from the dark, pulling players into side tunnels. <br> - Larger, gorilla-like versions of the humanoids acting as alpha predators. <br> - The tunnel itself shifting unnaturally, as though alive, guiding the creatures. |
| **Escaping Dinosaurs**     | - **Dinosaurs:** Velociraptors with glowing crystalline spines stalking through the jungle. <br> - Pterodactyls swooping to grab players or drop them into hazards. <br> - A massive armored ankylosaurus acting as a mobile barricade. <br> - Dilophosaurus spitting acidic venom to disable vehicles. <br> - A T. rex with cybernetic implants chasing the group relentlessly. |
| **Sinking Ferry**          | - **Water Monsters:** A kraken’s tentacles smashing through the ferry deck, grabbing passengers. <br> - Kelpies disguised as panicked survivors, trying to lure players into the water. <br> - Schools of razor-toothed fish attacking any swimmers. <br> - Water elementals surging through the lower deck, flooding and freezing areas. <br> - A monstrous, semi-aquatic crab acting as the “final boss.” |
| **Zoo Explosion**          | - **Alien Parasites:** Zoo animals infected by glowing alien parasites, making them stronger and more aggressive. <br> - A tiger with tentacle-like appendages sprouting from its sides. <br> - A gorilla with crystalline armor smashing through enclosures. <br> - A flaming peacock emitting bursts of heat and light. <br> - A parasitic hive mind controlling all the infected creatures, growing with every host. |
| **Looters vs. Candy Creatures** | - **Candy Critters:** Sentient licorice ropes lashing out as living tentacles. <br> - Chocolate knights wielding brittle but deadly sugar swords. <br> - Gummy bears forming into larger, amorphous blobs to overwhelm humans. <br> - Hard candy “rolling pins” acting like living battering rams. <br> - A marshmallow “queen” critter that engulfs and absorbs its surroundings. |
| **City-Wide Combat**       | - **All Monsters Combined:** The battlefield is a chaotic mix of creatures from every genre: dinosaurs rampage through the streets, steampunk automatons patrol, alien parasites infect the city’s animals, and candy critters add a bizarrely whimsical threat. <br> - **Kaiju Battle:** A colossal monster emerges, attacking both sides indiscriminately. The National Guard deploys tanks, airstrikes, and soldiers to fight it off. <br> - Smaller creatures act as distractions, forcing players to focus on multiple threats. <br> - Environmental hazards include collapsing skyscrapers and fires spreading rapidly. <br> - The final phase centers on either stopping the kaiju or sealing the portal it came through. |
