# **Scenario Title:** Subway Horror  

### **Characters:**
**All characters are part of a secret coven, identical stat blocks but with different spells.**

1. **Lila Meadows (Occult Scholar):**  
   - **Archetype:** Occult Researcher  
   - **Spells:** **Light** (Illuminate surroundings), **Barrier** (Block creatures).  

2. **Marcus Hale (Coven Protector):**  
   - **Archetype:** Soldier  
   - **Spells:** **Bolt** (Ranged magical attack), **Deflection** (Reduce attacks).  

3. **Naomi Blake (Natural Mystic):**  
   - **Archetype:** Rebel  
   - **Spells:** **Entangle** (Immobilize enemies), **Healing** (Recover Wounds).  

4. **Jonas Vex (Streetwise Warlock):**  
   - **Archetype:** Criminal  
   - **Spells:** **Obscure** (Create cover), **Blast** (Area magical attack).  

### **Enemies**

1. **Dire Wolf (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** Reskin as "eyeless humanoid crawlers" with enhanced speed and ferocity. Use their quickness and vicious attacks to emulate the terrifying nature of these creatures.

2. **Spider, Giant (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** Adapt as ceiling-crawling monstrosities. Their climbing ability and venomous attacks can simulate the danger of creatures tearing through characters with unnatural precision.

3. **Zombie (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** Represent the humanoid attackers' frenzied nature. Their durability and relentless pursuit of prey fit the theme of these horrifying, flesh-ripping monsters.

### Conflicts

1. **Secrecy vs. Exposure** *(Naomi vs. Marcus)*  
   - Naomi (Vengeful) wants to use magic openly to fight back against the creatures, arguing it’s their only chance for survival. Marcus (Loyal) insists on protecting the coven’s secrecy, even if it means taking a riskier approach.  

2. **Selfish Survival** *(Jonas vs. Lila)*  
   - Jonas (Greedy) is a coward and prioritizes his own survival (private note to this player, I want them to try and abandon everyone). Lila (Delusional) confronts him, insisting they need to stay united to overcome the danger.  

3. **Trust Issues** *(Jonas vs. Naomi)*  
   - Naomi (Charismatic) distrusts Jonas (Wanted), accusing him of putting the coven at risk with his criminal past and selfish behavior. Jonas counters by pointing out her own reckless tendencies.  

4. **Tactics vs. Recklessness** *(Lila vs. Marcus)*  
   - Lila (Cautious) pushes for a defensive, strategic approach, while Marcus (Overconfident) advocates for direct confrontation, insisting that he can handle the threats head-on.

### **Starting Area Description (Read Aloud):**  
"The subway car jolts to a sudden stop, sparks flying along the rails outside. Overhead lights flicker and die, replaced by dim emergency illumination that casts long, eerie shadows. The air is unnaturally still, broken only by the faint sound of distant scratching echoing down the tunnel.  

Around you, passengers glance nervously at one another. A man in a dirty hoodie mutters to himself, rocking back and forth in his seat. Another, shifty-eyed and clutching a bulging backpack, keeps glancing toward the doors. The air feels charged—tingling with the presence of something… otherworldly."

### **NPCs:**  
1. **Eric “Mumbles” Myers (Crazy Passenger):**  
   - Constantly muttering about “monsters in the dark,” possibly a red herring or a source of cryptic advice.  
   - May panic and draw attention at the worst moments.  

2. **Tara Cole (Shifty Crook):**  
   - A thief carrying stolen goods. Tara is more worried about getting caught than surviving.  
   - May sabotage the group to save herself, e.g., locking a door behind her.  

3. **Scared Teenager:**  
   - A terrified high schooler clinging to their phone, trying to text for help despite no signal.  
   - May need rescuing or become a liability by freezing in fear.

### **Possible Conflicts:**  

#### **Pre-Monster Arrival: Exploration and Preparation**  
1. **Investigate the Stalled Train:** Lila or Jonas senses magical interference with **Detect Arcana** or by observing unnatural shadows.  
2. **Broken Doors:** Marcus forces open jammed subway doors, or Jonas uses **Repair** to bypass the lock.  
3. **Passenger Panic:** Eric starts shouting about monsters, risking attracting attention. Naomi or Marcus can calm him with Persuasion or intimidation.  
4. **Suspicious Behavior:** Tara sneaks toward an emergency exit but refuses to explain her intentions.  

#### **Post-Monster Arrival: Combat and Survival**  
5. **First Attack:** Slick, eyeless humanoids drop from the ceiling, forcing the group into melee or spells like **Bolt** or **Blast**.  
6. **Pack Tactics:** Two humanoids ambush from behind while others block the exit, requiring Naomi’s **Entangle** or Lila’s **Barrier** to hold them back.  
7. **Light Problems:** The emergency lights fail. Lila’s **Light** spell illuminates the area but draws the creatures’ attention.  

#### **Escalation and Escape:**  
1. **Narrow Escape:** The group must navigate debris-filled tunnels while evading pursuers. Marcus or Naomi clears obstacles with Strength or **Healing** after injuries.  
2. **Tara Betrays the Group:** Tara locks a maintenance hatch behind her, forcing Jonas to use **Obscure** or stealth to bypass the blockade.  
3. **Final Stand:** A large humanoid blocks the exit. The group must work together to fight it off or lure it into a trap.
