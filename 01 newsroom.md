## **Starting Area Description (Read Aloud):**  

"The newsroom is sterile and professional, the hum of computers and the faint crackle of intercom chatter the only sounds cutting through the tense silence. Through the large glass windows, chaos is visible outside: sirens wail, shadows dart between the cars below, and distant screams echo faintly.  

### **Script for Anchor:**  

*Sarah Doyle takes a deep breath as the camera light flickers on, the red “Live” indicator glowing like a warning beacon.*  

**Anchor (Sarah Doyle):**  

"Good evening, viewers. I am Sarah Doyle and I apologize for the interruption of your regular programming with breaking news. Reports are flooding in from across the country—and around the world—about strange, violent outbreaks. Witnesses describe… monsters. Yes, monsters, emerging seemingly from thin air.

These incidents are sudden, unpredictable, and growing in number. Some of these… creatures appear to be armed, organized, and worse—dangerously intelligent. Citizens are advised to stay indoors and avoid open spaces at all costs.  

Here to shed more light on this unfolding crisis is General Marcus Stanton from the United States Armed Forces. General, thank you for joining us."

### **General Marcus Stanton Quick Guide**  

**The Truth:**  
- The situation is bad, but he’s ordered to downplay it.  

**Will NOT:**  
- Admit the scale of the crisis.  
- Confirm rumors (military failures, monsters of wildly differing size and appearance).  
- Discuss casualties.  

**Goals:**  
1. Reassure the public.  
2. Protect his superiors.  
3. Avoid direct answers.  

**Approach Suggestions:**  
- Calm and condescending OR Bullish and aggressive
- Use vague responses and military jargon.  

### **Questions for General Marcus Stanton:**  

The general is evasive and dismissive, downplaying the situation. The anchor’s questions push for clarity.  

1. "General, is it true that these monsters are appearing out of portals or rifts in the air?"  

2. "How widespread is this crisis, and are there any areas already overrun?"  

3. "Reports suggest that these creatures are intelligent. Does the military have a plan to deal with something of this nature?"  

4. "What can you say to reassure the public when the government seems caught off-guard?"  

5. "General, if the military is handling this, why are there already reports of towns being evacuated or abandoned?"  

6. "Are you hiding information from the public to prevent panic?"  

7. "What about reports of civilians being attacked by soldiers trying to ‘contain’ these creatures?"  

## Possible Conflicts

### **1. Pre-Monster Arrival: Social and Technical Challenges**
1. **Anchor vs. General (Social Conflict):**  
   Sarah tries to press the general for honest answers. She can use **Persuasion** or **Streetwise** to identify when he’s lying or avoiding the truth.  
   - The general can use his military background and **Persuasion** to deflect or control the narrative.  
   
2. **Technical Malfunction (Tech Challenge):**  
   The newsroom equipment malfunctions due to power surges from nearby portals. Jake can use **Electronics** or **Repair** to fix the camera or audio systems.  
   - Greg could assist by finding or moving heavy equipment.  

3. **Security Breach (Physical Conflict):**  
   A panicked bystander or looter tries to force their way into the newsroom, demanding shelter or a platform to "warn" people. Greg can intervene with **Athletics** or **Notice** to subdue or spot their intent.  

4. **Spotting Danger (Investigative Challenge):**  
   Greg or Sarah notices unusual activity outside (e.g., shadowy figures, distant screams). They must succeed on **Notice** rolls to spot the approaching threat before it arrives.  

5. **General’s Nervousness (Roleplay Cue):**  
   The general fumbles or shows subtle signs of stress (e.g., sweating, glancing nervously at his phone). Sarah can roll **Notice** to pick up on his unease and press him for information.

### **2. Post-Monster Arrival: Combat and Survival Challenges**
6. **First Attack (Combat Challenge):**  
   A **steampunk automaton** smashes through the window, targeting the closest person (possibly Jake or the general). Sarah or Greg can attempt to distract it while Jake escapes or fixes something critical.  

7. **Multiple Threats (Multi-Action Challenge):**  
   Clockwork spiders emerge from vents and disable studio lights. Jake can roll **Electronics** to restore power while Greg fights them off with **Athletics** or improvised weapons.  

8. **Environmental Hazard (Agility Challenge):**  
   The automaton knocks over a heavy light rig or camera, and someone must roll **Agility** or **Strength** to prevent it from crushing another character.  

9. **Blocking the Exit (Team Coordination):**  
   The floating drone seals the main exit with an electrical barrier.  
   - Jake can use **Electronics** to disable it.  
   - Greg can attempt to break through physically with **Athletics** or **Strength.**  

10. **Live Broadcast Danger (Stealth or Notice Challenge):**  
    A second automaton stalks into the newsroom unnoticed. The players must roll **Stealth** to hide or **Notice** to spot it before it strikes.  

---

### **3. Escalation and Escape: Dramatic Tension**
1. **Time Limit to Escape (Multi-Roll Challenge):**  
    As the newsroom collapses due to the attack, players must roll **Athletics**, **Notice**, or **Strength** to avoid falling debris and help NPCs escape.  

2. **Final Combat Push:**  
    The automaton blocks the final exit, requiring teamwork to fight it off or distract it while others escape.  
    - **Greg** uses physical force.  
    - **Jake** uses a tool or improvised weapon.  
    - **Sarah** uses Persuasion or Taunt to bait it away.  

3. **Moral Dilemma (Roleplay):**  
    A panicking NPC (e.g., Marla the intern) is trapped under rubble, forcing the players to decide between saving her or making their own escape.  

4. **Power Surge (Environmental Hazard):**  
    The automaton’s destruction causes a short-circuit, sparking an electrical fire. Players must use **Repair** or **Athletics** to minimize the damage or escape safely.  

5. 5. **Climactic Leap (Final Skill Check):**  
    As the group escapes, they must make a dramatic jump from the collapsing studio balcony to safety. A failed roll could lead to injuries or separation.
