### **The Veil Lifts**

The morning began at a **coven meeting**, a gathering of Wiccans and enthusiasts joining together to celebrate the earth. **Marge** arrived with a dish she called "dirt," a dessert made of actual dirt. **Lenore gagged.** Meanwhile, **Rosie** wandered off to check on a **catatonic squirrel**. At the conclusion of their ceremony, Marge seemed to have also entered a catatonic state. **Rowan** exhaled a cloud of **henbane smoke** into Marge’s face.  

The reaction was **instant and unnatural.**  

A **massive eruption of spirits** burst forth from Marge and every animal in the vicinity, including the squirrel. They howled in eerie unison:  
*“The veil has lifted.”*  
*“The doors are opening.”*  
*“Woe… woe…”*  

And then, in a violent **implosion of force**, the spirits were sucked back into Marge. She blinked, suddenly **lucid.** The squirrel scurried off, **alive again.**  

The rest of the coven, blissfully ignorant of the supernatural, barely reacted—except for **Lenore, who completely lost it.** The outburst earned her disapproving clicks of the tongue. To them, it seemed she was trying to steal attention from Marge’s episode.  

Shaken but unwilling to dwell, the group made their way to the subway.

### **The Man on the Tracks**  

Descending into the station, they barely registered the wail of **sirens**—just another night in New York. As they walked, **Rosie passed a graffiti-covered toothpaste ad**. For a brief second, the smiling man's **painted head turned to watch her.** She did a double take—nothing. Just the ad.  

On the platform, **Lenore spotted Babushka Yahga**, or just *Baba* to the community. She approached, only for Baba to publicly **embarrass her** with questions about when she’d finally join her for knitting and watching *their stories* (cheap, dramatic soaps). Baba was working on a pink sweater for her.  

Flustered, **Lenore accidentally bumped into a man**—a hunched figure in a **rumpled trench coat and fedora**.  

The man **stumbled forward, awkward but deliberate.** He pushed between **Rowan and Jasper**, who instinctively grabbed at him, only to snatch away **his hat.**  

The man **fell onto the tracks.**  

Before anyone could react, his **body convulsed** as he made contact with the **electric rail.** His limbs **twisted unnaturally.** Then, an **express train roared through**, swallowing him whole.  

But as it passed, **the blue spirits from earlier erupted once more, wailing the same dire warnings.**  

Then—**he was gone.** No body. No trace.  

The few other passengers on the platform looked at the group like they were crazy. But **Lenore saw Baba.** Baba had **seen everything.**

### **The Subway Stops. The Dark Things Stir.**  

Finally boarding their subway car, they encountered **Sparky, the local armless crackhead**, already rambling. **Rowan dosed him with mandrake**, and he settled comfortably into a seat.  

Then, **their phones shrieked.**  

An **emergency alert**.  
**The presidential seal.**  
A message:  

*"Shelter in place. Lock your doors. Await military assistance."*  

The **lights flickered, then failed completely.**  

Sparks **sputtered** across the tracks as the subway **groaned to a halt.**  

**Jasper caught a glimpse of something.**  

For a split second, the flashes of **electric arcs** illuminated **something clinging to the walls.**  

**It had no eyes. No hair.**  
Its **mouth was hidden in folds of flesh.**  
**Its limbs were impossibly long and slender, tapering into wicked black nails.**  

On **instinct**, Jasper **cast Light**—and the spell flared so **blindingly bright** that it illuminated the entire **outside of the car.**  

And that’s when they saw them.  

Not one.  
Not ten.  
**Hundreds.**  

The creatures **boiled over the walls and ceiling, recoiling from the light.**  

In the chaos, something else was moving—**an impossibly long, grasping hand reaching for Sparky.**  

Rosie **reacted fast, casting Entangle—duct tape fueled by desperation.** The spell **froze the arm in place** just long enough for her to **yank Sparky to safety.**  

Lenore, her curiosity overriding her fear, **stared out into the darkness.** The creatures **shrank from her glare.**  

She looked forward, toward the **head of the train.**  
Something **massive** was there.  
And behind them?  
**Hundreds more.**

### **The Maw Awaits**  

Rosie and Rowan braced for a fight.  

But Jasper—**of all people**—acted on **pure, reckless bravery.**  

Gripping one of his favorite **enchanted stones**, he **blasted it with light** and **charged into the next car.**  

Then the subway **lurched forward.**  

**Once.**  

**Twice.**  

The violent movement sent **Rowan flying into a chair, knocking the wind from her lungs.**  

**Baba moved.**  

She pressed **one of her knitting needles into Rowan’s hands.**  
She whispered something into **Lenore’s ear.**  
Then, in an act of **impossible strength**, she **forced open the doors** and **jumped.**  

There were **screams.**  

But **not hers.**

### **The Last Car**  

Jasper pushed forward, **his illuminated rock burning away the shadows.**  

The next car was **soaked in blood and shredded flesh**.  

The creatures **fled from the light.**  

And then—he reached **the last car.**  

The back half had been **shorn clean off.**  

And just ahead, blocking the tunnel, was something… **colossal.**  

**Its black, wizened skin stretched taut over muscle and bone.**  
**Its claws, long and jagged.**  
**Its teeth, the size of lawnmower blades.**  

It **scraped the inside of a train car** clean of the bodies inside, tossing it into its cavernous maw.

Then, with **unnatural ease**, it **tossed the entire car aside.**  

And it **turned toward him.**  

**Roll Initiative.**
