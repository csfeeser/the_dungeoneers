### **Starting Area Description (Read Aloud):**  
"The ferry rocks violently, throwing passengers and luggage across the deck. The lights flicker as the sound of a metallic groan reverberates through the hull. Water begins rushing in from the lower deck, and passengers scream, scrambling for life vests and exits.  

Near the stern, George and Edith Parker cling to each other as they steady themselves against a rail, bickering over what to do. Across the deck, Terry shouts orders to passengers, while Sandra rushes to help someone who’s fallen. Hal stands by the lifeboats, assessing the chaos with an opportunistic gleam in his eye. Suddenly, a screech pierces the air as something massive slams into the side of the vessel. The ship shudders again as strange shapes begin to claw their way aboard."
