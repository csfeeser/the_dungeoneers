## **Scenario Title:** Escaping Dinosaurs  

### **Characters:**  
**Each player is fleeing toward a supposed place of safety, chased by a dinosaur that matches their vehicle’s environment and vulnerabilities.**

1. **Roy “Big Rig” Stevens (The Trucker):**  
   - **Archetype:** Laborer  
   - **Vehicle:** **18-Wheeler** – A massive truck with a damaged trailer, slow but durable.  
   - **Dino Chasing Him:** Cybernetic T. Rex – Relentless and built for destruction, smashing through obstacles to reach him.  
   - **Roleplay Details:** Roy is a gruff, bearded trucker who constantly mutters things like, “Come on, old girl, don’t fail me now!” He refuses to abandon his rig, even when it puts him at risk.  

2. **Samantha “Sammy” Cruz (The Daredevil):**  
   - **Archetype:** Athlete  
   - **Vehicle:** **Motorcycle** – A fast and nimble dirt bike capable of jumping over obstacles but fragile and vulnerable to falls.  
   - **Dino Chasing Her:** Velociraptor Pack – Agile predators that leap through the jungle, trying to knock her off the bike.  
   - **Roleplay Details:** Sammy is a cocky stunt driver who thrives on adrenaline, often shouting, “Let’s see you keep up!” She pushes her limits but panics if cornered.  

3. **Chad “The Bro” Thompson (The Kiteboarder):**  
   - **Archetype:** Criminal  
   - **Vehicle:** **Wind Kite Board** – Agile and fast on the water but at the mercy of wind conditions and waves.  
   - **Dino Chasing Him:** Plesiosaur – A massive aquatic predator that leaps from the water, snapping at his kite.  
   - **Roleplay Details:** Chad is a thrill-seeking bro who refuses to take anything seriously, yelling things like, “This is gnarly, dude!” even when he’s in serious danger.  

4. **Oliver “Ollie” Grant (The Cameraman):**  
   - **Archetype:** Investigator  
   - **Vehicle:** **Helicopter** – Airborne but unstable, with Ollie barely able to control it after the pilot was taken.  
   - **Dino Chasing Him:** Pterodactyl Pack – Swarming and dive-bombing, trying to pluck him out of the cockpit.  
   - **Roleplay Details:** Ollie is a panicked cameraman who screams things like, “Why did I think I could do this?!” but somehow manages to keep the helicopter barely functional.  

### **Dinosaurs**

1. **Tyrannosaurus Rex**  
   - **Suggested:** **Minotaur (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** Use the minotaur as a base for a large, powerful predator. Adjust melee attacks to represent the T-Rex’s devastating bite and scale up its size for dramatic encounters.

2. **Velociraptor**  
   - **Suggested:** **Raptor (Birds of Prey)**  
   - **Why:** The raptor already fits the role with speed and deadly attacks. Reskin it as a ground-based dinosaur with sharp claws and pack-hunting behavior.

3. **Mesosaurus/Plesiosaur**  
   - **Suggested:** **Shark, Great White (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** The great white shark can easily represent a deadly aquatic dinosaur. Adjust its description to give it a long, serpentine body and reptilian features.

4. **Pterodactyl**  
   - **Suggested:** **Dire Wolf (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** Reskin as a flying predator with sharp talons and a dive attack. While not a perfect match, its speed and ferocity can simulate aerial ambushes effectively.

### **Starting Area Description (Read Aloud):**  
"The chaos of the portal is tearing the landscape apart. Each of you finds yourself alone, separated by miles of dense jungle, raging rivers, and open skies, with one terrifying reality: you are being hunted.  

Roy’s rig roars down a dirt road as the earth trembles behind him, the glowing red eyes of a cybernetic T. rex locking onto the truck.  

Sammy weaves her motorcycle through dense jungle trails, her bike kicking up dirt as a pack of velociraptors leaps through the underbrush, their snarls growing louder.  

Chad grips the bar of his kiteboard, the wind whipping past him as a massive plesiosaur bursts from the water, snapping at the kite’s trailing ropes.  

Above it all, Ollie frantically pulls on the helicopter’s controls, the rotors whining as a swarm of pterodactyls circles him, their talons glinting in the sunlight. Each of you races toward the only place you think you might be safe: a glowing beacon near the base of the distant mountains, rumored to be a secure portal research facility. But will you make it there alive?"

### **Conflicts: Air, Land, and Sea**

#### **Land-Based Conflicts (Roy and Sammy):**  
1. **Road Collapse (Roy):**  
   - A section of road gives way, forcing Roy to choose between risking the collapse or plowing through unstable ground.  

2. **Fallen Tree (Sammy):**  
   - A massive tree blocks the trail. Sammy must leap the bike over it or find a narrow detour, risking velociraptor ambushes.  

3. **Velociraptor Ambush (Sammy):**  
   - Raptors leap at the bike, trying to knock her off or force her into hazards.  

4. **Bridge Bottleneck (Roy):**  
   - Roy’s rig struggles to cross a narrow wooden bridge as the T. rex closes in, its weight shaking the structure.  

---

#### **Water-Based Conflicts (Chad):**  
1. **Plesiosaur Lunge:**  
   - The plesiosaur leaps from the water, snapping at Chad’s kite. If it hits, it could drag him into the water.  

2. **Wind Drop:**  
   - The wind dies momentarily, leaving Chad struggling to maintain control as the plesiosaur gains on him.  

3. **Coral Hazard:**  
   - A shallow reef forces Chad to swerve, risking a wipeout or getting tangled in the coral.  

4. **Wave Surge:**  
   - A rogue wave crashes down, threatening to knock Chad off the board or slam him into nearby rocks.  

---

#### **Air-Based Conflicts (Ollie):**  
1. **Pterodactyl Dive Bomb:**  
   - A pterodactyl slams into the cockpit, forcing Ollie to stabilize the helicopter or risk crashing.  

2. **Rotor Damage:**  
   - A pterodactyl grabs the rotors, causing a critical malfunction. Ollie must fight to regain control.  

3. **Narrow Canyon:**  
   - The helicopter enters a narrow canyon to evade the pterodactyls, requiring precise piloting.  

4. **Mid-Air Snatch:**  
   - A pterodactyl tries to grab Ollie or his passenger directly out of the helicopter, creating a desperate struggle.

### **Final Escape (All Players):**  
- **Convergence at the Facility:**  
   - All vehicles converge on the portal research facility, but the entrance is blocked by debris. Players must work together to clear the path or create distractions to fend off the pursuing dinosaurs.  
   - **Land:** Roy uses the truck to ram obstacles while Sammy provides cover with her speed.  
   - **Water:** Chad lures the plesiosaur away from the group, forcing it to crash into nearby rocks.  
   - **Air:** Ollie uses the helicopter to bait the pterodactyls into a trap or provide aerial assistance.
