### **Scenario Title:** Looters vs. Candy Critters  

### **Characters:**  
**All characters are humanoid or animal-like candies, excessively cheerful and adorable, but capable of horrifying, candy-themed powers.**

1. **Gummy (The Hugger):**  
   - **Archetype:** Occult Researcher  
   - **Spells:** **Barrier** (Trap enemies in a sticky gummy wall), **Blast** (Explode chunks of acidic gummy flesh).  
   - **Behavior:** Gummy is overly affectionate, constantly trying to hug everyone, even enemies. They giggle and say, “Let me stick with you!”  
   - **Horrifying Power:** Gummy secretes acidic slime that melts skin and bone, their hugs dissolving enemies as they cling tightly.  

2. **Ginger (The Sweet Inferno):**  
   - **Archetype:** Soldier  
   - **Spells:** **Bolt** (Fire sharpened candy shards), **Deflection** (Spiky sugar armor).  
   - **Behavior:** Ginger is bossy but cheerful, shouting things like, “You can’t crumble me!”  
   - **Horrifying Power:** When broken, Gingerbread shards fire out as jagged shrapnel, embedding themselves deeply in flesh and bone, causing agonizing pain.  

3. **Peeps (The Sticky Specter):**  
   - **Archetype:** Rebel  
   - **Spells:** **Entangle** (Trap enemies in marshmallow goo), **Obscure** (Cover the area in sticky powdered sugar).  
   - **Behavior:** Peeps is bubbly and excitable, chirping things like, “You’ll be mine forever!”  
   - **Horrifying Power:** Peeps engulfs enemies in sticky marshmallow flesh, suffocating them and absorbing their bones into their fluffy body.  

4. **Choco (The Dark Dripper):**  
   - **Archetype:** Criminal  
   - **Spells:** **Smite** (Coat allies’ weapons in acidic chocolate), **Blast** (Spray scalding chocolate).  
   - **Behavior:** Choco is smooth and unnervingly calm, murmuring things like, “Everything melts eventually…”  
   - **Horrifying Power:** Choco melts into an acidic sludge that burns through flesh and bone, leaving behind a skeletal mess. They reform from the sludge, seemingly unharmed.  

### **Enemies**

1. **Orc (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** Orcs can be reskinned as aggressive, regular humans with basic combat skills. Their stats are ideal for representing looters who are tough but not overly skilled.

2. **Soldier (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** Soldiers can serve as a baseline for looters with moderate training or more organized aggression. Strip out advanced tactics to fit their lack of discipline.

3. **Zombie (Reskinned)**  
   - **Why:** Reskin as desperate or frenzied civilians. While not mindless like zombies, their relentless behavior can represent looters driven by chaos and desperation.

### **Starting Area Description (Read Aloud):**  
"The convenience store buzzes faintly with fluorescent lights as looters yell and grab armfuls of snacks, knocking over shelves and shoving each other aside. Broken glass and spilled soda puddles cover the floor.  

In the candy aisle, a strange, sticky sound begins to grow louder. Four candy figures emerge from the shadows—small, colorful, and sweet-looking. A gummy bear waddles forward, arms wide for a hug. A gingerbread man steps boldly beside it, cracks glowing faintly with red light. A chirping marshmallow peep bounces forward, sticky goo dripping from its sides, while a smooth, shiny chocolate humanoid slithers along, their body glistening and molten.  

They giggle and cheerfully announce, 'Stealing is bad! Let’s make things sweet again!' as the air grows heavy with an acidic, sugary scent."

### **NPCs:**  
1. **Ben “Biceps” Carter (Loot Leader):**  
   - Muscular and overconfident, dismisses the candy critters as harmless until he realizes the horrors they can unleash.  
   - Commands the looters to keep stealing, even as chaos breaks out.  

2. **Maggie (Panicked Shopper):**  
   - A frightened shopper trapped in the store, begging not to be hurt. She tries to escape, potentially getting caught in the crossfire.  

3. **Tommy (Scared Teen Thief):**  
   - A young looter clearly in over his head, clutching a stolen bag of candy. He might switch sides or run away depending on how he’s handled.

1. **The Candy Critters Confront the Looters:**  
   - The critters face the looters, who mock them and continue stealing. Tensions rise as the critters demand the looters stop, but the looters refuse.  

2. **Maggie Tries to Escape:**  
   - Maggie makes a break for the door, but her path is blocked by fallen shelves or fighting. She cries for help, adding a layer of moral complexity to the situation.  

3. **Tommy Freezes:**  
   - Tommy panics as violence erupts, dropping his stolen bag. He either freezes in fear, tries to surrender, or bolts for an exit, creating chaos.  

4. **Ben Escalates the Fight:**  
   - Ben arms himself with a broken bottle or improvised weapon and demands the looters fight back against the candy critters.
